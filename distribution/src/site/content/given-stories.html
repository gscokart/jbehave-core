<h2>Reusing Textual Stories</h2>

<p>BDD encourages the description of the acceptance tests in a
manner that is intelligible and transparent to the business users. This
in particular may mean setting up explicitly via scenario steps all the
pre-requirements of a particular scenario. For complex scenarios this
will rapidly lead to maintainance problems due to duplication of entire
blocks of steps.</p>

<p>To help the user better manager more complex scenarios, JBehave
allow the specification of entire stories as a pre-requisite for another
scenario.</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Scenario:  A scenario in which the user can run other stories as pre-requisites
    
    GivenStories: path/to/precondition1.story,
                  path/to/precondition2.story,
                  ...
                  path/to/preconditionN.story
    
    Given ... // normal scenario steps
</pre>
<p>When JBehave encounters the keyword <b>GivenStories</b>, it will
run the (one or more) textual stories specified by path in the list
(using the same Steps instances specified for the parent story) before
proceeding to the execution of the normal scenario steps.</p>

<p>Another way to avoid duplication of textual scenario steps is to
use the natural ordering of execution of the story classes. Typically,
this means that the stories will be executed in the alphabetical order
of their names and a convention can be adopted to have stories start
with an alpha-numberical prefix, such as 'Snn' where 'nn' is an
incremental number. This though has the disadvantage of having to run
all stories leading up to the desired scenario, which in some cases can
be unnecessary and time consuming. For example, for debugging purposes
one may need to one run one scenario, which may have a dependency on
just one other story. This is where <b>GivenStories</b> is most useful.</p>

<h2>Parametrised GivenStories</h2>

<p>In the spirit of avoid unnecessary duplication, it useful at
times to allow parametrisation of given stories, i.e. executing them
with different sets of parameters. Parametrised given stories work on
the same principles of <a href="parametrised-scenarios.html">parametrised
scenarios</a>, using <a href="parameter-injection.html">parameter
injection</a>. The only thing that differs with the case of parametrised
scenarios is the convention by which the parameter sets are provided. It
still uses the <b>Examples:</b> keyword to collect the sets of
parameters, but it allows the user to provide via an <b>anchor</b>, an
optional appendix of the form <b>#{row}</b> to the story path, which is
interpreted as row number of the parameters to inject in the story
execution.</p>

<p>For example, if we want to execute the same given story with two
different sets of parameters, specified as the first and second row of
the examples table:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
    Scenario:  A scenario in which the user can run other stories as pre-requisites
               parametrised using the rows of the Examples table
    
    GivenStories: path/to/precondition.story#{0},
                  path/to/precondition.story#{1}
    
    Given ... // normal scenario steps
    
    Examples:
    |One|Two|
    |uno|due|
    |un|deux|
</pre>

<p>Conventionally, if the examples table is used to parametrised the
GivenStories (i.e. if anchors are present in the story paths), it is
assumed we are not using it to parameterise the scenario at the same
time. This behaviour may be made onfigurable in the future, depending on
the need.</p>
